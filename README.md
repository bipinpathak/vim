# What Is Vim?
Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.

# Getting Started
If you are on Linux or Mac, you will have vim installed by default. For windows, you can get it from [here](https://www.vim.org/download.php). The best way of getting familiar with vim is vimtutor. Run **vimtutor** command in your terminal, which will start a walkthrough.

# vimrc
Once you are familiar with the basic functionalities of vim you can start customizing it using a **.vimrc** file in your home directory.

# Configuration Options
Vim has many configuration options that you can use to modify its behavior, functionality, and appearance. A list of commonly used options is given [here](https://www.shortcutfoo.com/blog/top-50-vim-configuration-options/) with a brief description, and an exhaustive list is available in the [documentation](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html).

# Plugin Manager
You can choose to install plugins manually, but a plugin manager makes installation and maintaining updates easier. I have used Vundle. Follow the installation steps given [here](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).

# Plugins
The first step to using vim plugins is finding them. You can find a list of trending vim plugins at [VimAwesome](https://vimawesome.com/). Once you find a plugin, itâ€™s README will have instructions on properly installing and setting up the plugin.
